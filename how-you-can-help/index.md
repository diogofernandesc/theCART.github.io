Like any race team we need funding and help to develop our car. We were very lucky to get initial funds from the [Chelsea Academy Foundation](http://chelsea-academy-foundation.org/), which allowed us to buy the kit for our chassis.  However we still need to pay for the rest of the carâ€™s development and the cost of running the race team (Helmets, Driver and Pit Crew Overalls, race fees etc).

We need your support to complete the development of the car and successfully race it. We are looking for both funding and the supply of expertise and materials.

If you are a commercial organisation we are offering [sponsorship](/sponsors/) opportunities to advertise on our car and website and be linked with developing the engineering and business skills of young Londoners.

Here are some of the ways in which you can help us:

* Sponsor the car development (we need to buy materials for the bodywork, control electronics etc)
* Sponsor Driver clothing (overalls, helmets, shoes and gloves)
* Sponsor Pit Crew clothing (overalls, boots, hats)
* Provide transport (we need a trailer and a vehicle to pull it)
* Help us build a better car! If you have engineering expertise in designing and building chassis, bodywork or electronics we would love to hear from you!
* Come and support us at the races!
