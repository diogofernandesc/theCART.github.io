The car is currently under development and we are working tirelessly to make sure that we have a completed vehicle to race at [Goodwood](http://www.goodwood.co.uk/home.aspx) this year. However, we will be needing as much support as possible from you to ensure that we stand a great chance of competing in the Greenpower race.

Here are some of the ways in which you can help us:

- Purchase one of our branded products, which will [may] be released soon.
- Donate towards the development of our car.
- Provide us with access to industrial equipment such as:
  - CNC Milling machine
  - Wind Tunnel
  - Test track

If you have any questions or queries on how you help support us or donate, please do not hesitate to [contact us](/contact/).
