The car is currently under development and we are working tirelessly to make sure that we have a completed vehicle to race at Goodwood this year. However, we will be needing as much support as possible from you to ensure that we stand a great chance of competing, and winning, in the Goodwood racing competition. We will ensure that you have a good experience helping develop the Angry Gecko vehicle.

Here are some of the ways in which you can help us:

+ Purchase one of our branded products, which will [may] be released soon.
+ Donate towards the development of our car.
+ Provide us with access to industrial equipment such as:
  + CNC Milling machine
  + Wind Tunnel
  + Test track

If you have any questions or queries on how you help support us or donate, please do not hesitate to [contact us](/contact/).
