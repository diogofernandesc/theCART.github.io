## So what's this all about?

Weâ€™re a group of students building and designing an electric car to compete in the [Greenpower IET Formula F24](http://www.greenpower.co.uk/racing/formula24) race at the end of the year. The London heats will be taking place this June.

The young engineers working on this project are between 13 and 19 years old. Most of us intend to study mechanical engineering in the near future.

The Chelsea Academy Racing Team (CART) enrichment is an exciting prospect for young, aspiring engineers to develop their range of knowledge and skills in a fun and educational way. This is an exciting opportunity for everyone at [Chelsea Academy](http://chelsea-academy.org/) as we are pioneering this enrichment for the first time.
