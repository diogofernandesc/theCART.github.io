## So what's this all about?

Weâ€™re a group of students at [Chelsea Academy](http://chelsea-academy.org/) designing and building an electric car to compete in the [Greenpower IET Formula F24](http://www.greenpower.co.uk/racing/formula24) race.

The students working on this project are between 13 and 19 years old. Many of us plan to study engineering in the future.

As well as the engineering challenge of building the car we have to fund and run the race team. So as well as developing our engineering skills this is also teaching us Project Management and Marketing skills, which are essential in any successful business enterprise.

The Chelsea Academy Racing Team (C.A.R.T.) is an exciting prospect for young, aspiring engineers to develop their range of knowledge and skills in a fun and educational way.
