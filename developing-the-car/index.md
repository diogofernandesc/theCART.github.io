The IET Formula 24 series is a 90 minute endurance race where the teams aim to complete the maximum distance possible using one pair of regulation batteries. All teams must use the same model of batteries and motor supplied by Greenpower. 

While there are strict [regulations (pdf)](http://www.greenpower.co.uk/sites/default/files/library/Greenpower%202014%20Regulations.pdf) to ensure that the vehicles are safe, teams are free to innovate to create the most effective car possible.

As newcomers to the event Chelsea Academy has chosen to build our first car, the “Angry Gecko” Mark 1 (AG001), around a kit that allows us to build a chassis based on a classic aluminium ladder frame.

This year is about learning what it takes to get a car to the races! We are aiming to compete at the Goodwood heats on the 8th June. Our first body is going to be constructed out of 3mm ply and foam to allow us to build a working car to get experience of the races. 

We plan to get our first experience of racing this year and to then develop the car in subsequent seasons.

Next year we plan to include:

* Data logging and control electronics based around a Raspberry Pi
* Telemetry back to the pits via an iPhone
* A lighter body with better aerodynamics (material still to be decided...)
* The design of a new chassis for the third season of racing.
