The Chelsea Academy Racing Team, or CART, is composed of students aged between 13 and 19 years old who are studying at [Chelsea Academy](http://chelsea-academy.org/). The team meets every Friday during Chelsea Academy’s enrichment period, during which we work on designing and constructing our car, the Angry Gecko.

We are all passionate about Engineering which is why we have chosen to take part in this enrichment. Some of our Sixth Formers have even received offers to study Engineering at University!

The CART Enrichment is being pioneered for the first time this year by our team. We hope that the CART Enrichment will continue in future years, encouraging Chelsea Academy’s students to develop in their skills and become our future engineers.
