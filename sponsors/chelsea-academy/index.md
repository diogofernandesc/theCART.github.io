##{{ page.name }}

Chelsea Academy is a new Academy started 5 years ago. We are a science specialist academy and are rated as outstanding by Ofsted. Located next to the World’s End Estate we serve one of the most underprivileged areas in the UK. Our mission is to provide outstanding educational opportunities to all our students regardless of background.

As part of our STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Maths) activities we are designing and building an electric car that will compete on a national level with other schools in [Greenpower’s F24 event](http://www.greenpower.co.uk/racing/formula24). This project aims to develop student’s engineering, business, marketing and leadership skills. It is run by the Sixth Form and involves students from Year 9 -13.
